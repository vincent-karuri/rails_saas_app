# README
This project involves creating a website that provides a platform for entrepreneurs, developers and investors to meet. It provides for free users, who get limited functionality, and pro users who get access to the entire community for 
a monthly fee of $10.

The website backend is implemented using Ruby on Rails while the front-end uses CSS, HTML and JavaScript.
